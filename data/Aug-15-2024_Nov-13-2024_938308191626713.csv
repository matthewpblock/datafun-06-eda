You might notice a new ""drop-in"" option on drawing & painting classes. If you've signed up for a series of my classes before, you can pick that as an option. So even  if you can't make every single one, you can still brush up on your skills in whatever you want to focus on. 

I also added private lesson rates to each type of art class. Since there is no way I can possibly fit everyone's schedules, that may be a good option for you or your student. Siblings can do the same time as each other to make it easier for you.

As always, just let me know if you have any questions!

And I can also confidently say that I have students in my classes who are drawing and painting at levels high enough to win art contests. So if you are a student of mine, past or present, and this topic intrigues you enough to participate, please know you are welcome to ask for my help. From brainstorming to critiquing for improvement to scanning and submitting - let me know what you need.

If you or your kids have taken one of my classes, you are welcome join my private Facebook group, Art Classes With Rebecca. (or if you're friends & family) I'll be using it more soon to do live videos of studio work, q&a, tutorials, etc. And y'all can post your work in there too! I know it can be scary to share but I'd really love to see your creative projects, too! I know who everyone is in there, so it's not a bunch of randos. My people are nice people and they won't tear your work apart or anything. But if you or your kids are wanting tips on improvements for your artwork, you can safely ask for it in there. It's also family-friendly content. You'll have to request to join and wait for my admin approval.

(7:30 for my Missouri friends) I'll be adding to the page of croton leaves on that board. Grab yourself a fall leaf and come chill. Use whatever paint or supplies you have at home. Or just watch and say hello! Your choice. 

I believe in public discourse of ideas rather than censoring, but I also believe in appropriate boundaries, and you should not come to the live video if you can't restrain yourself from talking politics or putting little emojis that indicate what party you hope will win. People are anxious and stressed today (I'm not) and I want them to be able to come and relax without thinking about that for a bit.",,0,"11/05/2024 10:10",N/A,https://www.facebook.com/rebeccablockartworks/posts/pfbid026sUv1uMfCWDfqt7VjarabqRzNSCVTAqxwV4y1UcBHERTZNkYqmCrjTvev118ECPQl,0,0,Photos,,,,,Lifetime,0,162,142,15,14,0,1,6,5,1,,0,162,0,142,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15,0,0

If for some reason the button on my site says ""unavailable,"" please hit ""refresh"" to see if it becomes available. I've had some weird website issue this past week and just finished talking to Square's customer support. It seems to be happening with Drawing and Painting classes in particular. Hopefully it is resolved soon and doesn't give you problems! But if it never allows you to register and you're seeing classes on the drop-down menu from JULY instead of SEPTEMBER, please contact me instead! We can figure out a more manual way to do it. 😜",,0,"09/08/2024 12:29",N/A,https://www.facebook.com/rebeccablockartworks/posts/pfbid02jciY1jNQVQXgxNLCjh7fCooJRxX33bzospnhG7o15b6pFzmaoV84DXrGKUdpDXhdl,0,0,Links,,,,,Lifetime,,134,98,2,1,1,0,2,2,,,,134,0,98,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0
