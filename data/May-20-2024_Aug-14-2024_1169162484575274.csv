982713803578978,100055211027046,"Rebecca Block Art and Design","Hello everyone! June art classes are starting next week and I have two spots in June for a Thursday clay class that I'd love to fill! That one is 10:30am-12pm (June 6, 13, 20) with makeup dates we can discuss if you know you have to miss one. (Link to website with more info is in comments)

There's also a Clay Camp I originally offered Mon/Tues/Wed the first week of June, but nobody has signed up for it yet. I assume it's a scheduling issue when I see that! So if several families are interested in a June clay class and want to find a day/time that works for all of us, please comment below. I can message you all so we can find something that works for all of us. 🙂 

Other than that, if you're serious about signing up for another kind of art class then I'm very open to switching around days and times for certain classes if what's listed doesn't work with your schedule. I'd rather switch things around and get people learning art and having fun than have a completely empty class! I've already had a few moms organize their own friend groups or kid groups this way & they are all excited to have some summer fun together!

The [flexible] calendar and class descriptions are linked in the comments. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!

If you frequent my website, you'll see art classes posted around the 15th of every month. If you sign up for my emails there, I try to send that out around that date as well. If you try to keep up-to-date with my classes via social media, well.....good luck. 😆 It's not where I put most of my time and energy when it comes to marketing my classes. Since the email campaign data is far more encouraging than the Facebook data, I don't expect that to change. 😁 So enjoy the video montage I managed to create for this post, but DEFINITELY go to the website more often if you've been wanting to sign your kids (or yourself!) up for art classes.

P.S. You might want to check your spam/filtered folder settings if you haven't been seeing my emails! Some of y'all been bouncing back for some mysterious reason!

I loved hearing and seeing signs of them learning how to construct their creations! I asked them to plan ahead by sketching their ideas on paper, then asked them along the way to think through the steps of their project. How would they would construct it? Would one method be better than another, and why? If something you tried didn't work, what's another thing we could try to make the next version better? 

And most importantly (/most repeated by me)....if that chonk of clay you just added dries and you didn't score and slip it, what will happen??? 🤪",,0,"06/22/2024 16:36",N/A,https://www.facebook.com/rebeccablockartworks/posts/pfbid02rthqAqfZiKsFEZeo6AFAyQdaHi1dKiJLQpsZU6Ho5pptUMjtTZPX2CJtztbCQ31Jl,0,0,Photos,,,,,Lifetime,104,93,2,2,0,0,7,5,2,,104,0,93,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,,,,,,

It definitely wasn't, but it must have looked like it after I'd tidied it up last weekend. 🤣🤣🤣 Now it's messy time again!

Please know I say the following with the utmost respect for what teachers do, but with an even deeper desire to improve the educational experience of our keiki.

This watercolor palette was on my son's supply list last summer. It came back to me at the end of the year, completely unused. I just discovered it in his backpack the same week I went to one of the richest cultural experiences I've ever had at FestPAC. (Some of the art I purchased is also pictured.)

I went twice, by the way (and watched the closing ceremonies on TV) because it was THAT incredible. I went so I could learn about the diverse types of art across the Pacific so I could, in turn, share it with my private art class students. I went so I could thoroughly compare the arts of the Pacific to art from other areas of the world where I've had deep, meaningful experiences. **I went so I could fill the gap that our schools are leaving when it comes to benefitting from fine arts teachers.**

Students at the vast majority of elementary schools here are not getting that art experience. Teachers who specialize in teaching core subjects are also expected to teach skills that take YEARS to develop. You are LUCKY in Hawai'i if your kids are in an elementary school that considers fine arts staff ESSENTIAL. If your kids are getting the amazing experience that a trained art teacher provides, count your blessings. I'm envious.

Hawai'i public schools: We can do better when it comes to teaching fine arts for our keiki. We cannot continue assuming that ""generalist"" elementary teachers are able to provide the depth of learning that a content-specific art teacher can provide. HIRE. ART. TEACHERS. We are not add-ons. We are not a caveat in your budget. We SHOULD be an essential, basic part of your elementary school staff. 

I don't even have room in this post to share the plentiful research about true art education in schools. Two words: ""attendance"" and ""grades.""

WE. CAN. DO. BETTER. Rise to the challenge!!
