My take....Art put in public places should inherently expect to be subject to the additions and opinions of the public. Sometimes it's graffitied and torn down (as in the example of statues of southern Confederate generals). Sometimes it's torn out of the sides of buildings and auctioned off (as in the example of Banksy's graffiti). And sometimes it gets googly eyes stuck to it. 

The last one is my personal favorite. If I ever do a mural, I hope the public adds giant googly eyes to it. 

Actually, maybe I'll just straight-up add them myself.

✅The lovely #roadtohana with my family...and back again (and btw, it's not that bad if you've got a country boy driving ya while you passenger princess) 🤣
✅Painted red sand and turquoise waters on #Kaihalulu Beach (it's not as vibrantly red as many photos out there lead you to believe)
✅Attended koholā party in Ma'alaea Bay
✅Paddled outrigger canoe and watched the sun rise over the mountains
✅Investigated ""weird"" washed-up things on the beach, like wana and ula poni
✅Held a giant parrot in my hands, on each shoulder, and on my head. At the same time. (Don't tell my #Waipahu chicken friends, but I loved the parrots more.)
✅Bought #maui chocolate, mandarins, manzanas, and coconut candy from roadside stands
✅Itched to get back to an orchid painting I started last week
✅Didn't watch TV or the ongoing telenovela americana, and it was fahhhhhbulous.

P.S. I have manually adjusted the color and contrast in this photo to look more like what I saw IRL, but IG might be adding a label required by Meta as ""using AI."" It's exactly the type of simple edit I did before ""AI"" existed - the type of settings that were available in all photo-editing software for all time. I guess they're calling it by a different name now. At any rate, it was 100% taken by my husband on his phone and adjusted manually by me in my phone's original camera app to look more accurate than the camera's color and contrast processing. I never use AI to fake stuff, just to occasionally edit things I've personally written to make them more clear and concise. But not this, as you can probably tell by my long-winded paragraph with the subversive insinuation that I have an ongoing annoyance with disgenuous ""influencer"" photos.

But I also REALLY needed to use my brain in ways that reminded me I was more than a caretaker for small children. The learning curve of watercolor worked my brain in ways that were incredibly fulfilling in a different sort of way than momming all day. It kept me from going insane, to be honest. And I'm drawn to orchids because they're a very complicated-looking flower. Yep, I like a challenge! Here are three I've been personally hoarding on my walls, but I think I can relinquish them now. ;-) Comment below if you're interested and I'll message prices for these originals.

I usually email within the hour to say hello and ask you about days and times you want to do your lessons.

If you STILL don't see it, please contact me via email or phone! I also try calling and texting folks if I haven't heard from them yet. You can pick any of those forms of communication. You can use the form on my website (www.hawaiiartclasses.com), or you can call my studio line at 808-671-0295.

Eventually, I will have to assume that perhaps someone changed their mind or they were confused about something. (If this is the case, it is always best to just reach out to me!)
