Never thought I'd say that but some opportunities you just gotta roll with! We're loving it, learning the language and culture, enjoying the food and the amazing time in nature. We are honored to be here and love the relationships we've made with so many people the last couple years.

I've started a business here to teach art classes to kama'aina adults,  keiki, teens, and the occasional visitor, so if you want in on that, DM me. (Old website is getting a total revamp.) I'm on O'ahu but am very able to do virtual inter-island classes with a very small group. Daytime homeschool classes will be starting in April, with afternoon classes after the public schools let out. More types of classes will be added over the summer. Each series of classes will be 4 weeks, and I will help you hone whatever skills you have. No matter what level you're at, I will meet you there.

I'm not gonna be tripping over myself trying to do social media things, because I don't foresee it being helpful for what I aim to do. So the upcoming posts will be more like a portfolio so those who need to know can see my style of work and experience. Just because I wasn't posting art since COVID doesn't mean I wasn't creating, so I have a backlog of stuff I should post eventually. But consider my social media posting to be on island time. I got other things to do.

 Look, I'm even gonna do this without hashtags:",,0,"02/26/2024 19:31",N/A,https://www.facebook.com/rebeccablockartworks/posts/pfbid02s6px6a5ebiJFMhNF5kScUitioeZfTAwUHgaD4BdqvT6M9fiAuezMM5kmuHyRaLiFl,0,0,Photos,,,,,Lifetime,426,366,76,55,19,2,45,11,34,,426,0,366,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,53,0,0,,,,,

I really like this method of testing your paint on the edges (which would typically be covered by a mat....this is the standard way to display paper artwork so the art is not sticking against the glass.) Is this realistic style how I normally work? No. Did I learn SO MUCH STUFF from some amazing artists that I can apply to my own style in the future? ABSOLUTELY!!!! 

A funny thing about it, though.....I usually avoid doing this style because I know I could do it really, really well. But I struggle with perfectionist tendencies and I DON'T want to make art like this because it makes it worse for me. I would sit there for DAYS trying to perfect a single piece. NOT doing this style of super realistic work and doing looser, imperfect work helps me to chilllllll out. 

But I have ZERO regrets about doing this workshop because the quality of feedback I got from the teachers and other artists was absolutely invaluable. Although I've been taking online and in-person workshops throughout the years, absolutely nothing came close to being able to learn from other artists in-person. 

Also. I really love that science-minded artists are able to critique my art in a logical and clear way. I absolutely loathe art-world talk that relies on descriptions of wishy-washy feelings rather than reason and evidence. If you have a high opinion of art that is displayed in museums or galleries, you probably don't want to visit them with me because I'll call out the baloney. You'll never look at artist statements the same way without rolling your eyes. 🤣 Sorrynotsorry",,0,"04/18/2024 18:52",N/A,https://www.facebook.com/rebeccablockartworks/posts/pfbid0ZaQiNL2FrmdxnJehjiaAncyKWwsn6mNBVXq9P2zCRotDkacJ8YHhzwkWSzPpdyGKl,0,0,Photos,,,,,Lifetime,111,106,10,5,5,0,10,2,8,,111,0,106,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,,,,,

Really liking the stick erasers too! (Tombow Mono Zero brand) Both of these are something I learned how to use back in February at an in-person workshop. I'm REALLY glad I spent the time and money to learn from people better than myself so I could step up certain components of my art skills. Online video tutorials have their place (and I use them myself occasionally), but NOTHING can take the place of learning art live and in-person. And it's because of **teacher feedback.** If you aren't getting that from an art class, you're missing a key component to your own learning.

Not only are they great for molding and pressing on paper to lighten an area of a shaded object, but they can also be used as a sticky holder for an object you're working on. On top of that, you can take a tiny dot of the stuff and use it as a visual marker on something Fibonacci-esque like a pineapple, pinecone, etc.
